- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JennDW967. Thanks for stopping by!
- I am new to Github, but am excited to be here.
- Iâ€™m interested programming languages and data visualization tools. 
- Iâ€™m currently learning SQL and R programming languages so that I can transition into a more Data Analyst-focused role. I also want to learn Python in the near future.
- I love science, history, nature, food, and rock music.
